**Task1:- Create a Dictionary of student marks**  
     **Explanation:-** In this code a dictionary name 'student_list' is made, which holds the name of students  
     as the keys and the marks as the values, and then into a variable named 'name_student' the name of the  
     student of which they needed the marks of are taken as input by from the user, then using the if-else  
     block the output is either the students name and marks if the name given by the user is in the dictionary  
     or tells the user that the given name is not in the dictionary.  

**Task2:- Demostrate list slicing**  
       **Explanation:-** In this code a new list is created called as 'numbers' which contains numbers from  
       1 to 10, then a new list named 'new_numbers' is made to store the extracted 5 numbers from the  
       'numbers' list and then the numbers in new_numbers are made to be reversed using the reverse()  
       then the final 'new_numbers' reversed list is printed.
